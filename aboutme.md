So, I guess here's all you need to know about me: I'm currently a CS-major undergrad student at ZJU. 

It's indeed kind of awkward to begin like this, but I'd rather still gonna get started here - I've been majoring in **Computer Science** at Zhejinag Univ. since 2024. 

And hence, I guess it a good idea to talk about my research related works - I'm focused in the field of LLM SSAP (*S*ecurity, *S*afety, *A*lignment & *P*rivacy), and ongoing with two projects (one for LLM jailbreak defense, and another for RAG privacy perservation) for about a year. This period seems to be quite stressing, considering during then I was just in my year 1, and it is indeed. 

However, majoring in CS doesn't necessary mean bundles for research and peer pressure - it could also be of some pleasure, especially when you got involved into GNU/Linux and etc. And further more, I've even take into consideration to run a job as DevOps / SRE engineer after graduation, if I didn't really get admitted into some research PhD programs.

And in addition, there's some other bulletins that you might be interested of, such as:

- I'm a furry fandom, ever since my 15s / 16s.

- I'm using vim on debian sid to build this site, with my favorite KDE Plasma.

- I produce some rubbish post-mordenism posts here from now and then.

Whatever you've read, I still hope that my page could be helpful - at least so as I hope. You can contact me via the email below :)
