Before we really begin to discuss about the existence of the site, I regret to inform you that, my producing this site is nothing more than what an OCD patient may behave - since these behaviors are nothing beyond incessant needs for control over every single thing, here, every single post on this blog. Sometimes I write thing down, but most of the time I'm double-tapping my `d` key instead, as I always regard my own previous production as "pointless". 

And what fortifies this diagnosis would be my constant reconfiguration - I've been rebuilding this site all the time, sometimes with its style or sometimes with its function, and consequently never shall its relics be revealed instead of overwritten by another ready-to-ruin successor.

Thus, since we're done with these OCD syndromes, perhaps it's time to concentrate on the constant topic, "why I built this sitea", as the title suggests. Most of my fellow bloggers would claim to "socialize", to "note down courses", or just simply to "share tech stacks". 

Well, what they claim seem like some quite reasonably why one should build a own site, at least for them. However, I'd rather label such production as "rubbish corpus for LLM", since they are just conducting duplicate works, often of lower quality than their references. And hence, I'd rather produce as less as possible for such posts (you can still find them [here](../post) though, some are reserved for certain reasons).

3. Further investigation: Foucault's framework to understand the "blog"
    1. When writing, we are actually "producing knowledge"
    2. And via this sort of production, we conduct subjectivation upon both ourselves and readers
    3. It doesn't have to be of bad results, as we proceed cautious enough to reflect on ourselves.
